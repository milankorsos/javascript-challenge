JavaScript Exercise
============
 
* Create a basic HTML form.
* Modify the form so if the user submits the form with a blank input the page turns red.
* Create a register which records every valid input from the form.
* Create an object prototype for books with the following properties:
- Name
- Date created
- Count
* Updating the form should increment the count for the instance of that book.
* Extend the book prototype with an encyclopedia prototype. In addition to the properties a book has, an encyclopedia has a year property. (The year can default to being the current year.)
* Create a mechanism to distinguish book and encyclopedia input.
* Add a new element to the page. Append user input from the form to that element, only if the input is an encyclopedia.
* Display encyclopedias in alphabetical order.
